## 0.0.2
- Added a config file to customize the spawn chance, the scrap value, and the interest timer of the Dog Toy item
- When thrown, the Dog Toy will now create an interest for Eyeless Dogs every 0.2 seconds instead of every frame, and this will now last for 20 seconds
- The "forced spawn of dogs" effect of the item will now start a bit earlier during the night, and it will be more common on moons that can't spawn any Eyeless Dogs
- Fixed item interaction upon droping or despawning the Dog Toy item
